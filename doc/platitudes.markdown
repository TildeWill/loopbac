CTO - Chief Therapy Officer

Care and Feeding of People

Making people awesome

LOOP: Hire bright people, build culture, attracts more bright people

Everyone deserves to be happy

People are built to communicate

People quit their bosses -> No bosses?

7-10 Direct reports

Decouple compensation change (reward, past) from feedback (feedback, future)

Give motivated people the tools they need to make themselves better

Let people control their destiny

Shared space between manager and employee

Like all questions that deal with people "It depends"

I want people to know themselves: "nosce te ipsum", or a la the Matrix "temet nosce"

Employee needs to see value in 1:1's, getting feedback...

Value adaptation (action) over success vs. failure
